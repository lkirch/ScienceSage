For me, the Moon has this weird mythic nature to it. ... There is still a mystery to it. As a location, it bridges the gap between science fiction and science fact. We (humankind) have been there. It is something so close and so plausible and yet at the same time, we really don\\'t know that much about it.\\nThe director described the lack of romance in the Moon as a location, citing images from the Japanese lunar orbiter SELENE: \"It\\'s the desolation and emptiness of it ... it looks like some strange ball of clay in blackness. ... Look at photos and you\\'ll think that they\\'re monochrome. In fact, they\\'re not. There simply are no primary colours.\" Jones made reference to the photography book Full Moon by Michael Light in designing the look of the film.\\nMoon\\'s budget was US$5 million. The director took steps to minimise production costs, such as keeping the cast small and filming in a studio. Moon was produced at Shepperton Studios, in London, where it was filmed in 33 days. Jones preferred using models to digital animation, working with Bill Pearson, the supervising model maker on Alien, to help design the lunar rovers and helium-3 harvesters in the film. The Moon base was created as a full 360-degree set, measuring 85–90 feet (26–27 m) long and approximately 70 feet (21 m) wide. The Moon base\\'s artificial intelligence, GERTY, was designed to be bound to an overhead rail within the mining base since its mechanical tether was critical to the story\\'s plot. Spacey\\'s vocal portrayal of GERTY was heavily influenced by HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), voiced by Douglas Rain. The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, which has sought cut-price deals with independent films. Since Jones had an effects background with TV advertisements, he drew on his experience to create special effects within a small budget.\\nTo save further on production costs, Jones re-used several set pieces from an abandoned movie based on the BBC TV sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. These include the sleeping quarters and the corridor of the \"secret room\".', 'title': 'Moon (2009 film)', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_(2009_film)', 'categories': ['Category:2000s American films', 'Category:2000s British films', 'Category:2000s English-language films', 'Category:2000s science fiction adventure films', 'Category:2000s survival films', 'Category:2009 directorial debut films', 'Category:2009 films', 'Category:2009 independent films', 'Category:All Wikipedia articles written in British English', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements', 'Category:American independent films', 'Category:American science fiction adventure films', 'Category:American space adventure films', 'Category:Articles with short description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from January 2022', 'Category:British independent films', 'Category:British science fiction adventure films', 'Category:Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Category:English-language independent films', 'Category:English-language science fiction adventure films', 'Category:Exploration of the Moon', 'Category:Films about artificial intelligence', 'Category:Films about astronauts', 'Category:Films about cloning', 'Category:Films directed by Duncan Jones', 'Category:Films produced by Trudie Styler', 'Category:Films scored by Clint Mansell', 'Category:Films set in 2035', 'Category:Films set in the future', 'Category:Films set on the Moon', 'Category:Films shot at Shepperton Studios', 'Category:Hard science fiction films', 'Category:Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form–winning works', 'Category:Official website different in Wikidata and Wikipedia', 'Category:Rotten Tomatoes ID same as Wikidata', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Category:Sony Pictures Classics films', 'Category:Stage 6 Films films', 'Category:Template film date with 3 release dates', 'Category:Two-handers', 'Category:Use British English from February 2024', 'Category:Use dmy dates from February 2024'], 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Blue_iPod_Nano.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Dragon-149393.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Sam_Rockwell_and_Duncan_Jones_at_2009_Tribeca_Moon.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Sf-userbox.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/Moon_%282009_film%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg'], 'summary': \"Moon is a 2009 science fiction film directed by Duncan Jones (in his directorial debut), written by Nathan Parker from a story by Jones. It stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining helium-3 on the far side of the Moon. Dominique McElligott, Kaya Scodelario, Benedict Wong, Matt Berry, Malcolm Stewart, Kevin Spacey appear in supporting roles. \\nMoon premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was released in selected cinemas in New York and Los Angeles on 12 June 2009. The release was expanded to additional theatres in the United States on 10 July and to the United Kingdom on 17 July. A follow-up film containing an epilogue to the film's events, Mute, was released in 2018. A third installment, a graphic novel called Madi: Once Upon a Time in the Future, was released in 2020.\\nMoon was modestly budgeted and grossed just under $10 million worldwide, but was well received by critics. Rockwell's performance found praise. The film won numerous film critic and film festival awards and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Film, and won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 2010.\", 'chunk_index':
