Ancient astronomers were able to make geometric observations with various instruments. The collection of precise observations in the early modern period and the invention of the telescope helped determine the overall structure of the Solar System. Telescopic observations resulted in the discovery of moons and rings around planets, and new planets, comets and the asteroids; the recognition of planets as other worlds, of Earth as another planet, and stars as other suns; the identification of the Solar System as an entity in itself, and the determination of the distances to some nearby stars.\\nFor millennia, what today is known to be the Solar System was regarded as the \"whole universe\", so the knowledge of both mostly advanced in parallel. A clear distinction was not made until around the mid-17th century. Since then, incremental knowledge has been gained not only about the Solar System, but also about outer space and its deep-sky objects.\\nThe composition of stars and planets was investigated with spectroscopy. Observations of Solar System bodies with other types of electromagnetic radiation became possible with radio astronomy, infrared astronomy, ultraviolet astronomy, X-ray astronomy, and gamma-ray astronomy.\\nRobotic space probes, the Apollo program landings of humans on the Moon, and space telescopes have vastly increased human knowledge about the atmosphere, geology, and electromagnetic properties of other planets, giving rise to the new field of planetary science.\\nThe Solar System is one of many planetary systems in the galaxy. The planetary system that contains Earth is named the \"Solar\" System. The word \"solar\" is derived from the Latin word for Sun, Sol (genitive Solis).

Research and exploration of the Moon have been a large focus of the organization since the Apollo program. NASA's peak budget was in 1964–1965, when it comprised 4% of all federal spending in service of the Apollo Moon landing project. Though lunar landings since the conclusion of the Apollo program in 1972 have ceased, interest in establishing a permanent habitation on the lunar surface or beyond low Earth orbit has remained steady. Recently, renewed interest in lunar landing has led to increased funding and project planning. NASA requested an increase in the 2020 budget of $1.6 billion, in order to make another crewed mission to the Moon under the Artemis program by 2025 (originally 2024), (delayed to 2026) followed by a sustained presence on the Moon by 2028. A crew was selected for the planned crewed mission, Artemis II, in April 2023.\", 'chunk_index': 11, 'char_start': 7582, 'char_end': 8174, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:54.053138+00:00',

Research and exploration of the Moon have been a large focus of the organization since the Apollo program. NASA's peak budget was in 1964–1965, when it comprised 4% of all federal spending in service of the Apollo Moon landing project. Though lunar landings since the conclusion of the Apollo program in 1972 have ceased, interest in establishing a permanent habitation on the lunar surface or beyond low Earth orbit has remained steady. Recently, renewed interest in lunar landing has led to increased funding and project planning. NASA requested an increase in the 2020 budget of $1.6 billion, in order to make another crewed mission to the Moon under the Artemis program by 2025 (originally 2024), (delayed to 2026) followed by a sustained presence on the Moon by 2028. A crew was selected for the planned crewed mission, Artemis II, in April 2023.\", 'chunk_index': 11, 'char_start': 7582, 'char_end': 8174, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:54.053138+00:00',

It is not explicitly necessary as the initial boost given by the rocket, gravity slingshot, monopropellant/bipropellent attitude control propulsion system are enough for the exploration of the solar system (see New Horizons). Once it has done so, it must make its way to its destination. Current interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of short-term trajectory adjustments. In between these adjustments, the spacecraft typically moves along its trajectory without accelerating. The most fuel-efficient means to move from one circular orbit to another is with a Hohmann transfer orbit: the spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun. A short period of thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous orbit and also to the orbit of its destination. The spacecraft falls freely along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its destination.\", 'title': 'Spacecraft propulsion', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion', 'categories': ['Category:Discovery and exploration of the Solar System', 'Category:Glenn Research Center', 'Category:NASA programs', 'Category:Spacecraft components', 'Category:Spacecraft propulsion', 'Category:Spaceflight technology'], 'topic': 'other', 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Creative_Commons_by_small.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Engine_of_APOLLO_Eagle.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Ion_Engine_Test_Firing_-_GPN-2000-000482.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Lightcraft.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Patent_Family_publications_in_Sustainable_Propulsion.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Pathfinder_Air_Bags_-_GPN-2000-000484.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg'], 'summary': 'Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites. In-space propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be confused with space launch or atmospheric entry.\\nSeveral methods of pragmatic spacecraft propulsion have been developed, each having its own drawbacks and advantages. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping, while a few use momentum wheels for attitude control. Russian and antecedent Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north–south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used electric propulsion such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters. Various technologies need to support everything from small satellites and robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to Mars.\\nHypothetical in-space propulsion technologies describe propulsion technologies that could meet future space science and exploration needs. These propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective exploration of the Solar System and may permit mission designers to plan missions to \"fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations\" and with greater reliability and safety. With a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are \"best\" for future missions is a difficult one; expert opinion now holds that a portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations.', 'chunk_index': 13, 'char_start': 10628, 'char_end': 11799,

Typically a Disk-Gap-Band parachute has been used, but another possibility are trailing or attached inflatable     entry devices. Inflatable types include sphere w/ fence, teardrop w/ fence, isotensoid, torus, or tension cone and attached types include isotensoid, tension cone, and stacked toroid blunted cone. Viking Program era researchers were the true pioneers of this technology, and development had to be restarted after decades of neglect. Those latest studies have shown that tension cone, isotensoid, and stacked torus may be the best types to pursue.\\nFinland's MetNet probe may use an expandable entry shield if it is sent. Martian air can also be used for aerobraking to orbital velocity (aerocapture), rather than descent and landing. Supersonic retro-propulsion is another concept to shed velocity.\\nNASA is carrying out research on retropropulsive deceleration technologies to develop new approaches to Mars atmospheric entry.\", 'title': 'Mars atmospheric entry', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_atmospheric_entry', 'categories': ['Category:Atmosphere of Mars', 'Category:Exploration of Mars', 'Category:Extraterrestrial atmosphere entry'], 'topic': 'mars', 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/2001_mars_odyssey_wizja.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/675608main_edl20120809-full.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/HiRISE_Captured_Perseverance_During_Descent_to_Mars_%28cropped%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/MSL_Artist_Concept_%28PIA14164_crop%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/MSL_HeatShield.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Mars-Science-Laboratory-Mars-Entry-Trajectory.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Opportunity_heat_shield_Sol335B_P2364_L456-B339R1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Phoenix_Lander_seen_from_MRO_during_EDL2.jpg'], 'summary': 'Mars atmospheric entry is the entry into the atmosphere of Mars.

Formed in 1993, MEP has made use of orbital spacecraft, landers, and Mars rovers to explore the possibilities of life on Mars, as well as the planet's climate and natural resources. The program is managed by NASA's Science Mission Directorate by Doug McCuistion of the Planetary Science Division. As a result of 40% cuts to NASA's budget for fiscal year 2013, the Mars Program Planning Group (MPPG) was formed to help reformulate the MEP, bringing together leaders of NASA's technology, science, human operations, and science missions.\", 'chunk_index': 16, 'char_start': 13799, 'char_end': 13914, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:54.216492+00:00', 'embedding': [0.06651762872934341,

Probes sent from Earth, beginning in the late 20th century, have yielded a large increase in knowledge about the Martian system, focused primarily on understanding its geology and habitability potential. Engineering interplanetary journeys is complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly sixty percent of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their missions, with some failing before their observations could begin. Some missions have been met with unexpected success, such as the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which operated for years beyond their specification.', 'chunk_index': 11,

In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data.

The capsule measured temperature, pressure, density and performed 11 automatic chemical experiments to analyze the atmosphere. It discovered that the atmosphere of Venus was 95% carbon dioxide (CO2), and in combination with radio occultation data from the Mariner 5 probe, showed that surface pressures were far greater than expected (75 to 100 atmospheres).\\nThese results were verified and refined by the Venera 5 and Venera 6 in May 1969. But thus far, none of these missions had reached the surface while still transmitting.\", \"Venus Express\\nVenus Express was a mission by the European Space Agency to study the atmosphere and surface characteristics of Venus from orbit. The design was based on ESA's Mars Express and Rosetta missions. The probe's main objective was the long-term observation of the Venusian atmosphere, which it is hoped will also contribute to an understanding of Earth's atmosphere and climate. It also made global maps of Venerean surface temperatures, and attempted to observe signs of life on Earth from a distance.\\nVenus Express successfully assumed a polar orbit on April 11, 2006. The mission was originally planned to last for two Venusian years (about 500 Earth days), but was extended to the end of 2014 until its propellant was exhausted. Some of the first results emerging from Venus Express include evidence of past oceans, the discovery of a huge double atmospheric vortex at the south pole, and the detection of hydroxyl in the atmosphere.\", \"Pioneer era: 1973–1979\\nIn the late 1960s, a concept known as the Planetary Grand Tour was developed in the United States by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It would allow a single spacecraft to travel past the asteroid belt and onto each of the outer planets, including Jupiter, if the mission was launched in 1976 or 1977. However, there was uncertainty over whether a spacecraft could survive passage through the asteroid belt, where micrometeoroids could cause it physical damage, or the intense Jovian magnetosphere, where charged particles could harm sensitive electronics. To resolve these questions before sending the more ambitious Voyager missions, NASA and the Ames Research Center launched a pair of twin probes, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 on March 3, 1972 and April 6, 1973, respectively, on the first uncrewed mission to the outer Solar System.\\nPioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to reach the Jupiter system on December 3, 1973. It passed within 357,000 km (222,000 mi) of Io. During Pioneer 10's fly-by of Io, the spacecraft performed a radio occultation experiment by transmitting an S-band signal as Io passed between it and Earth.\", \"Current missions\\nPlanned missions\\nImpact\\nResearch on the atmosphere of Venus has produced significant insights not only about its own state but also about the atmospheres of other planetary objects, especially of Earth. It has helped to find and understand the depletion of Earth's ozone in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nThe voyage of James Cook and his crew of HMS Endeavour to observe the Venus transit of 1769 brought about the claiming of Australia at Possession Island for colonisation by Europeans.\", \"Remotely controlled landers such as Viking, Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers have landed on the surface of Mars and several Venera and Vega spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus, with the latter deploying balloons to the planet's atmosphere. The Huygens probe successfully landed on Saturn's moon, Titan.\\nNo crewed missions have been sent to any planet of the Solar System. NASA's Apollo program, however, landed twelve people on the Moon and returned them to Earth.  The American Vision for Space Exploration, originally introduced by U.S. President George W. Bush and put into practice through the Constellation program, had as a long-term goal to eventually send human astronauts to Mars. However, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed cancelling the program in Fiscal Year 2011.  An earlier project which received some significant planning by NASA included a crewed fly-by of Venus in the Manned Venus Flyby mission, but was cancelled when the Apollo Applications Program was terminated due to NASA budget cuts in the late 1960s.\"], 'ground_truth_chunks': ['451501cf-51c2-5954-abab-35ff573a201d'], 'precision_at_k': 0.0, 'recall_at_k': 0.0, 'reciprocal_rank': 0.0, 'ndcg_at_k': 0.0, 'topic': 'other', 'level': 'Middle School', 'metadata': {'source_text': 'Pioneer Venus\\nIn 1978, NASA sent two Pioneer spacecraft to Venus.

As a result, Mars has seasons much like Earth, though on average they last nearly twice as long because the Martian year is about 1.88 Earth years. Mars's temperature regime is more similar to Earth's than to any other planet's in the Solar System. While generally colder than Earth, Mars can have Earth-like temperatures in some areas and at certain times.\", 'Orbital characteristics\\nThe orbital motion of Phobos has been intensively studied, making it \"the best studied natural satellite in the Solar System\" in terms of orbits completed. Its close orbit around Mars produces some distinct effects. With an altitude of 5,989 km (3,721 mi), Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. Therefore, from the point of view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4°. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14° wide; at zenith, it is 0.20°, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent size of about 0.35° in the Martian sky.', 'Martian system\\nMars has long been the subject of human interest. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent linear features were ascribed to intelligent design. Further telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos and Deimos, polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons, the Solar System\\'s tallest mountain. The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a thin atmosphere; it has a cold and desert-like surface.\\nOne way the surface of Mars has been categorized, is by thirty \"quadrangles\", with each quadrangle named for a prominent physiographic feature within that quadrangle.', \"See also\\nMars sample return mission\\nInSights References\\nExternal links\\n2002 Edition of Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars\\nBoldyGo's webpage for SCIM Archived 2015-09-27 at the Wayback Machine\", 'One strategy the Rover team uses is to position the Rover on northward faced slopes to get more sunlight, and because the gully runs east–west, they were often able to use the southern edge of the gully channel of Perseverance Valley to tilt the rover this way. The Martian winter solstice was in November 2017, and it is the 8th one that MER-B has passed through.\\nSome energy production readings from 2017:.', 'Hellas Planitia\\nHellas Planitia is the lowest lying plain below the Martian geodetic datum. The atmospheric pressure is relatively higher in this place when compared to the rest of Mars.', 'The hypothesis also predicts certain observations, such as the similar angular velocity of Mars and Earth with similar rotation periods and axial tilts. In this scheme, there are six principal planets: two terrestrial, Venus and Earth; two major, Jupiter and Saturn; and two outer, Uranus and Neptune, along with three lesser planets: Mercury, Mars, and Pluto.\\nThis hypothesis has some problems, such as failing to explain the fact that the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction with relatively low eccentricity, which would appear highly unlikely if they were each individually captured..', \"If the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore Martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\\nSubsequently, the systematic data errors that Singer predicted were found to exist, the claim was called into doubt, and accurate measurements of the orbit available by 1969 showed that the discrepancy did not exist. Singer's critique was justified when earlier studies were discovered to have used an overestimated value of 5 centimetres (2.0 in) per year for the rate of altitude loss, which was later revised to 1.8 centimetres (0.71 in) per year. The secular acceleration is now attributed to tidal effects, which create drag on the moon and therefore cause it to spiral inward.\\nThe density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3 (0.0682 lb/cu in). Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.\", 'Recurring slope lineae\\nSeasonal flows on warm Martian slopes (also called recurring slope lineae, recurrent slope lineae and RSL)  are thought to be salty water flows occurring during the warmest months on Mars.  Indeed, there is much photographic and spectroscopic evidence that water does today flow on parts of Mars.\\nSome researchers have proposed that the flow is aided by the water boiling in thin Martian atmosphere.  Boiling water would cause soil particles to bounce and help them to flow down slopes.\\nIn a study published in Icarus in 2016, A team, headed by David Stillman, identified 239 locations for recurring slope lineae within Valles Marineris.  About half of lineae locations on Mars are in Valles Marineris.  It was found that the lengthening of the lineae depends on how the slope is orientated.  Lengthening was observed in all seasons inside Valles Marineris.  This long active season suggests that there must be an appreciable source of water that supplies the lineae. Calculations show that the lineae are active between minus 27 degrees C and minus 9 degrees C to display the activity observed.', \"Mantle\\nMuch of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust.  This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land. But in places it displays a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young.\\nIt's generally accepted that mantle is ice-rich dust that fell from the sky as snow and ice-coated dust grains during a different climate    One evidence of its ice-rich nature is the presence of gullies which form when some of the ice melts.\\nThe images below, all taken with HiRISE, show a variety of views of this smooth mantle.\"], 'ground_truth_chunks': ['88ae4373-5538-5c86-bf6d-e88b8a89ef3f'], 'precision_at_k': 0.0, 'recall_at_k': 0.0, 'reciprocal_rank': 0.0, 'ndcg_at_k': 0.0, 'topic': 'mars', 'level': 'Middle School', 'metadata': {'source_text': \"Temperature and seasons\\nMars has an axial tilt of 25.19°, similar to Earth's 23.44°.

Mars's temperature regime is more similar to Earth's than to any other planet's in the Solar System. While generally colder than Earth, Mars can have Earth-like temperatures in some areas and at certain times.\", \"Water and climate\\nWater on Mars is scarce, with rovers Spirit and Opportunity finding less than in Earth's driest desert. (which is The Atacama Desert in northern Chile)\\nThe climate is much colder than Earth, with mean surface temperatures between 186 and 268 K (−87 and −5 °C) (depending on the season and latitude). The lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 184 K (−89.2 °C) in Antarctica.\\nBecause Mars is about 52% farther from the Sun, the amount of solar energy entering its upper atmosphere per unit area (the solar constant) is around 43.3% of what reaches the Earth's upper atmosphere. However, due to the much thinner atmosphere, a higher fraction of the solar energy reaches the surface as radiation. The maximum solar irradiance on Mars is about 590 W/m2 compared to about 1000 W/m2 at the Earth's surface; optimal conditions on the Martian equator can be compared to those on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic in June. Mars's orbit is more eccentric than Earth's, increasing temperature and solar constant variations over the course of the Martian year. Mars has no rain and virtually no clouds, so although cold, it is permanently sunny (apart from during dust storms).\", 'Hyper arid conditions\\nCold compared to most arid deserts because of the altitude\\nHigh levels of UV light (because it is relatively cloudless, also the higher altitude means less air to filter the UV out, and the ozone layer is somewhat thinner above sites in the southern hemisphere than above corresponding sites in the northern hemisphere)\\nSalt basins, which also include perchlorates making them the closest analogues to Martian salts on Earth.', \"Advantages\\nMars exists on the outer edge of the habitable zone, a region of the Solar System where liquid water on the surface may be supported if concentrated greenhouse gases could increase the atmospheric pressure. The lack of both a magnetic field and geologic activity on Mars may be a result of its relatively small size, which allowed the interior to cool more quickly than Earth's, although the details of such a process are still not well understood.\\nThere are strong indications that Mars once had an atmosphere as thick as Earth's during an earlier stage in its development, and that its pressure supported abundant liquid water at the surface. Although water appears to have once been present on the Martian surface, ground ice currently exists from mid-latitudes to the poles. The soil and atmosphere of Mars contain many of the main elements crucial to life, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon.\\nAny climate change induced in the near term is likely to be driven by greenhouse warming produced by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and a consequent increase in atmospheric water vapor.\", 'By traveling to locations with favorable tilt, dubbed \"lily pads\", Opportunity managed to receive over about 300 watt-hours per day even as the heart of the Mars winter approached. The Martian winter minimum was predicted for February 2014, but by making use of the northward slopes the rover had enough power to remain mobile during the Martian winter. By the end of October the rover was climbing up Solander point, where it was hoped some of the oldest rocks yet seen would be examined. The rocks were believed to date to Mars\\'s Noachian Period about four billion years ago, and could have provided some science surprises by Christmas. The team was hunting for \"juicy\" slopes of 5 to 20 degrees for more power.\\nAs it ascended, it doglegged in early November to avoid an area of dusty ripples. It continued to collect data on Martian rocks and dust in the area. Total odometry by November 5, 2013 (or in Mars days since the landing, Sol 3478) was 38.53 km (23.94 mi). Energy production from the Sun on that date was 311 watt-hours, with Tau at 0.536 and the dust factor at 0.491..', 'Atmosphere\\nAtmospheric pressure on Mars is far below the Armstrong limit at which people can survive without pressure suits. Since terraforming cannot be expected as a near-term solution, habitable structures on Mars would need to be constructed with pressure vessels similar to spacecraft, capable of containing a pressure between 30 and 100 kPa. The atmosphere is also toxic as most of it consists of carbon dioxide (95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, and traces totaling less than 0.4% of other gases, including oxygen).\\nThis thin atmosphere does not filter out ultraviolet sunlight, which causes instability in the molecular bonds between atoms. For example, ammonia (NH3) is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours. Also due to the thinness of the atmosphere, the temperature difference between day and night is much larger than on Earth, typically around 70 °C. However, the day/night temperature variation is much lower during dust storms when very little light gets through to the surface even during the day, and instead warms the middle atmosphere.', \"Life on Mars can also be searched for by finding signatures of past and present life or biosignatures. Relative carbon abundance and the location and forms that it can be found in can inform where and how life may have developed. Also, the presence of carbonate minerals, along with the fact that Mars's atmosphere is made up largely of carbon dioxide, would tell scientists that water may have been on the planet long enough to foster the development of life.\\nCharacterize the climate of Mars – Another goal of the MEP is to characterize both the current and past climate of Mars, as well as factors that influence climate change on Mars. Currently what is known is that the climate is regulated by seasonal changes of Mars's ice caps, movement of dust by the atmosphere, and the exchange of water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere. To understand these climatic phenomena means helping scientists more effectively model Mars's past climate, which brings a higher degree of understanding of the dynamics of Mars.\\nCharacterize the geology of Mars – The geology of Mars is differentiable from that of Earth by, among other things, its extremely large volcanoes and lack of crust movement.\", \"Mars's atmosphere varies significantly over the course of a Mars year, which prevents engineers from being able to develop a system for EDL common among all missions. Frequently-occurring dust storms increase lower atmospheric temperature and lessen atmospheric density, which, coupled with the extremely variable elevations on Mars's surface, forces a conservative selection of a landing site in order to allow for sufficient craft deceleration. With Mars EDL sequences only lasting about 5–8 minutes, the associated systems must be unquestionably reliable. Ideally, this would be verified by data obtained by carrying out large-scale tests of various components of the EDL systems on Earth-based testing. However, the costs of reproducing environments in which this data would be relevant in terms of Mars's environment are considerably high, resulting in testing being purely ground-based or simulating results of tests involving technologies derived from past missions..\", 'In addition, because on Mars atmospheric oxygen is lost into space (unless an artificial magnetosphere were to be created; see \"Protecting the atmosphere\" below), such life would need to be cultivated inside a closed system.\\nOn April 26, 2012, scientists reported that lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).\\nOne final issue with albedo reduction is the common Martian dust storms. These cover the entire planet for weeks, and not only increase the albedo, but block sunlight from reaching the surface. This has been observed to cause a surface temperature drop which the planet takes months to recover from. Once the dust settles it then covers whatever it lands on, effectively erasing the albedo reduction material from the view of the Sun..', \"Countering the effects of space weather\\nMars has no intrinsic global magnetic field, but the solar wind directly interacts with the atmosphere of Mars, leading to the formation of a magnetosphere from magnetic field tubes. This poses challenges for mitigating solar radiation and retaining an atmosphere.\\nThe lack of a magnetic field, its relatively small mass, and its atmospheric photochemistry, all would have contributed to the evaporation and loss of its surface liquid water over time. Solar wind–induced ejection of Martian atmospheric atoms has been detected by Mars-orbiting probes, indicating that the solar wind has stripped the Martian atmosphere over time. The current loss rate of CO2 from Mars's atmosphere to space is equivalent to approximately 1 millibar per billion years .  For comparison, while Venus has a dense atmosphere, it has only traces of water vapor (20 ppm) as it lacks a large, dipole-induced, magnetic field.\\nEarth's ozone layer provides additional protection.

Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967, Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9, some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.', \"Early landings\\nOn March 1, 1966, the Venera 3 Soviet space probe crash-landed on Venus, becoming the first spacecraft to reach the surface of another planet.\\nThe descent capsule of Venera 4 entered the atmosphere of Venus on October 18, 1967, making it the first probe to return direct measurements from another planet's atmosphere. The capsule measured temperature, pressure, density and performed 11 automatic chemical experiments to analyze the atmosphere. It discovered that the atmosphere of Venus was 95% carbon dioxide (CO2), and in combination with radio occultation data from the Mariner 5 probe, showed that surface pressures were far greater than expected (75 to 100 atmospheres).\\nThese results were verified and refined by the Venera 5 and Venera 6 in May 1969. But thus far, none of these missions had reached the surface while still transmitting.\", \"Venus Express\\nVenus Express was a mission by the European Space Agency to study the atmosphere and surface characteristics of Venus from orbit. The design was based on ESA's Mars Express and Rosetta missions. The probe's main objective was the long-term observation of the Venusian atmosphere, which it is hoped will also contribute to an understanding of Earth's atmosphere and climate. It also made global maps of Venerean surface temperatures, and attempted to observe signs of life on Earth from a distance.\\nVenus Express successfully assumed a polar orbit on April 11, 2006. The mission was originally planned to last for two Venusian years (about 500 Earth days), but was extended to the end of 2014 until its propellant was exhausted. Some of the first results emerging from Venus Express include evidence of past oceans, the discovery of a huge double atmospheric vortex at the south pole, and the detection of hydroxyl in the atmosphere.\", \"Pioneer era: 1973–1979\\nIn the late 1960s, a concept known as the Planetary Grand Tour was developed in the United States by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It would allow a single spacecraft to travel past the asteroid belt and onto each of the outer planets, including Jupiter, if the mission was launched in 1976 or 1977. However, there was uncertainty over whether a spacecraft could survive passage through the asteroid belt, where micrometeoroids could cause it physical damage, or the intense Jovian magnetosphere, where charged particles could harm sensitive electronics. To resolve these questions before sending the more ambitious Voyager missions, NASA and the Ames Research Center launched a pair of twin probes, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 on March 3, 1972 and April 6, 1973, respectively, on the first uncrewed mission to the outer Solar System.\\nPioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to reach the Jupiter system on December 3, 1973. It passed within 357,000 km (222,000 mi) of Io. During Pioneer 10's fly-by of Io, the spacecraft performed a radio occultation experiment by transmitting an S-band signal as Io passed between it and Earth.\", \"Current missions\\nPlanned missions\\nImpact\\nResearch on the atmosphere of Venus has produced significant insights not only about its own state but also about the atmospheres of other planetary objects, especially of Earth. It has helped to find and understand the depletion of Earth's ozone in the 1970s and 1980s.\\nThe voyage of James Cook and his crew of HMS Endeavour to observe the Venus transit of 1769 brought about the claiming of Australia at Possession Island for colonisation by Europeans.\", \"Remotely controlled landers such as Viking, Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers have landed on the surface of Mars and several Venera and Vega spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus, with the latter deploying balloons to the planet's atmosphere.

However, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed cancelling the program in Fiscal Year 2011.

Its close orbit around Mars produces some distinct effects. With an altitude of 5,989 km (3,721 mi), Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates. Therefore, from the point of view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4°. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14° wide; at zenith, it is 0.20°, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent size of about 0.35° in the Martian sky.', 'Martian system\\nMars has long been the subject of human interest. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent linear features were ascribed to intelligent design. Further telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos and Deimos, polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons, the Solar System\\'s tallest mountain. The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a thin atmosphere; it has a cold and desert-like surface.\\nOne way the surface of Mars has been categorized, is by thirty \"quadrangles\", with each quadrangle named for a prominent physiographic feature within that quadrangle.', \"See also\\nMars sample return mission\\nInSights References\\nExternal links\\n2002 Edition of Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars\\nBoldyGo's webpage for SCIM Archived 2015-09-27 at the Wayback Machine\", 'One strategy the Rover team uses is to position the Rover on northward faced slopes to get more sunlight, and because the gully runs east–west, they were often able to use the southern edge of the gully channel of Perseverance Valley to tilt the rover this way.

The atmospheric pressure is relatively higher in this place when compared to the rest of Mars.', 'The hypothesis also predicts certain observations, such as the similar angular velocity of Mars and Earth with similar rotation periods and axial tilts. In this scheme, there are six principal planets: two terrestrial, Venus and Earth; two major, Jupiter and Saturn; and two outer, Uranus and Neptune, along with three lesser planets: Mercury, Mars, and Pluto.\\nThis hypothesis has some problems, such as failing to explain the fact that the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction with relatively low eccentricity, which would appear highly unlikely if they were each individually captured..', \"If the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore Martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\\nSubsequently, the systematic data errors that Singer predicted were found to exist, the claim was called into doubt, and accurate measurements of the orbit available by 1969 showed that the discrepancy did not exist. Singer's critique was justified when earlier studies were discovered to have used an overestimated value of 5 centimetres (2.0 in) per year for the rate of altitude loss, which was later revised to 1.8 centimetres (0.71 in) per year. The secular acceleration is now attributed to tidal effects, which create drag on the moon and therefore cause it to spiral inward.\\nThe density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3 (0.0682 lb/cu in). Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.\", 'Recurring slope lineae\\nSeasonal flows on warm Martian slopes (also called recurring slope lineae, recurrent slope lineae and RSL)  are thought to be salty water flows occurring during the warmest months on Mars.  Indeed, there is much photographic and spectroscopic evidence that water does today flow on parts of Mars.\\nSome researchers have proposed that the flow is aided by the water boiling in thin Martian atmosphere.  Boiling water would cause soil particles to bounce and help them to flow down slopes.\\nIn a study published in Icarus in 2016, A team, headed by David Stillman, identified 239 locations for recurring slope lineae within Valles Marineris.  About half of lineae locations on Mars are in Valles Marineris.  It was found that the lengthening of the lineae depends on how the slope is orientated.  Lengthening was observed in all seasons inside Valles Marineris.  This long active season suggests that there must be an appreciable source of water that supplies the lineae. Calculations show that the lineae are active between minus 27 degrees C and minus 9 degrees C to display the activity observed.', \"Mantle\\nMuch of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust.  This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land. But in places it displays a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young.\\nIt's generally accepted that mantle is ice-rich dust that fell from the sky as snow and ice-coated dust grains during a different climate    One evidence of its ice-rich nature is the presence of gullies which form when some of the ice melts.\\nThe images below, all taken with HiRISE, show a variety of views of this smooth mantle.\"], 'ground_truth_chunks': ['88ae4373-5538-5c86-bf6d-e88b8a89ef3f'], 'precision_at_k': 0.0, 'recall_at_k': 0.0, 'reciprocal_rank': 0.0, 'ndcg_at_k': 0.0, 'topic': 'mars', 'level': 'Middle School', 'metadata': None}\n",

(which is The Atacama Desert in northern Chile)\\nThe climate is much colder than Earth, with mean surface temperatures between 186 and 268 K (−87 and −5 °C) (depending on the season and latitude). The lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 184 K (−89.2 °C) in Antarctica.\\nBecause Mars is about 52% farther from the Sun, the amount of solar energy entering its upper atmosphere per unit area (the solar constant) is around 43.3% of what reaches the Earth's upper atmosphere. However, due to the much thinner atmosphere, a higher fraction of the solar energy reaches the surface as radiation. The maximum solar irradiance on Mars is about 590 W/m2 compared to about 1000 W/m2 at the Earth's surface; optimal conditions on the Martian equator can be compared to those on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic in June. Mars's orbit is more eccentric than Earth's, increasing temperature and solar constant variations over the course of the Martian year. Mars has no rain and virtually no clouds, so although cold, it is permanently sunny (apart from during dust storms).\", 'Hyper arid conditions\\nCold compared to most arid deserts because of the altitude\\nHigh levels of UV light (because it is relatively cloudless, also the higher altitude means less air to filter the UV out, and the ozone layer is somewhat thinner above sites in the southern hemisphere than above corresponding sites in the northern hemisphere)\\nSalt basins, which also include perchlorates making them the closest analogues to Martian salts on Earth.', \"Advantages\\nMars exists on the outer edge of the habitable zone, a region of the Solar System where liquid water on the surface may be supported if concentrated greenhouse gases could increase the atmospheric pressure. The lack of both a magnetic field and geologic activity on Mars may be a result of its relatively small size, which allowed the interior to cool more quickly than Earth's, although the details of such a process are still not well understood.\\nThere are strong indications that Mars once had an atmosphere as thick as Earth's during an earlier stage in its development, and that its pressure supported abundant liquid water at the surface. Although water appears to have once been present on the Martian surface, ground ice currently exists from mid-latitudes to the poles. The soil and atmosphere of Mars contain many of the main elements crucial to life, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon.\\nAny climate change induced in the near term is likely to be driven by greenhouse warming produced by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and a consequent increase in atmospheric water vapor.\", 'By traveling to locations with favorable tilt, dubbed \"lily pads\", Opportunity managed to receive over about 300 watt-hours per day even as the heart of the Mars winter approached. The Martian winter minimum was predicted for February 2014, but by making use of the northward slopes the rover had enough power to remain mobile during the Martian winter. By the end of October the rover was climbing up Solander point, where it was hoped some of the oldest rocks yet seen would be examined. The rocks were believed to date to Mars\\'s Noachian Period about four billion years ago, and could have provided some science surprises by Christmas. The team was hunting for \"juicy\" slopes of 5 to 20 degrees for more power.\\nAs it ascended, it doglegged in early November to avoid an area of dusty ripples. It continued to collect data on Martian rocks and dust in the area. Total odometry by November 5, 2013 (or in Mars days since the landing, Sol 3478) was 38.53 km (23.94 mi). Energy production from the Sun on that date was 311 watt-hours, with Tau at 0.536 and the dust factor at 0.491..', 'Atmosphere\\nAtmospheric pressure on Mars is far below the Armstrong limit at which people can survive without pressure suits. Since terraforming cannot be expected as a near-term solution, habitable structures on Mars would need to be constructed with pressure vessels similar to spacecraft, capable of containing a pressure between 30 and 100 kPa. The atmosphere is also toxic as most of it consists of carbon dioxide (95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, and traces totaling less than 0.4% of other gases, including oxygen).\\nThis thin atmosphere does not filter out ultraviolet sunlight, which causes instability in the molecular bonds between atoms. For example, ammonia (NH3) is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours. Also due to the thinness of the atmosphere, the temperature difference between day and night is much larger than on Earth, typically around 70 °C. However, the day/night temperature variation is much lower during dust storms when very little light gets through to the surface even during the day, and instead warms the middle atmosphere.', \"Life on Mars can also be searched for by finding signatures of past and present life or biosignatures. Relative carbon abundance and the location and forms that it can be found in can inform where and how life may have developed. Also, the presence of carbonate minerals, along with the fact that Mars's atmosphere is made up largely of carbon dioxide, would tell scientists that water may have been on the planet long enough to foster the development of life.\\nCharacterize the climate of Mars – Another goal of the MEP is to characterize both the current and past climate of Mars, as well as factors that influence climate change on Mars. Currently what is known is that the climate is regulated by seasonal changes of Mars's ice caps, movement of dust by the atmosphere, and the exchange of water vapor between the surface and the atmosphere. To understand these climatic phenomena means helping scientists more effectively model Mars's past climate, which brings a higher degree of understanding of the dynamics of Mars.\\nCharacterize the geology of Mars – The geology of Mars is differentiable from that of Earth by, among other things, its extremely large volcanoes and lack of crust movement.\", \"Mars's atmosphere varies significantly over the course of a Mars year, which prevents engineers from being able to develop a system for EDL common among all missions. Frequently-occurring dust storms increase lower atmospheric temperature and lessen atmospheric density, which, coupled with the extremely variable elevations on Mars's surface, forces a conservative selection of a landing site in order to allow for sufficient craft deceleration. With Mars EDL sequences only lasting about 5–8 minutes, the associated systems must be unquestionably reliable. Ideally, this would be verified by data obtained by carrying out large-scale tests of various components of the EDL systems on Earth-based testing. However, the costs of reproducing environments in which this data would be relevant in terms of Mars's environment are considerably high, resulting in testing being purely ground-based or simulating results of tests involving technologies derived from past missions..\", 'In addition, because on Mars atmospheric oxygen is lost into space (unless an artificial magnetosphere were to be created; see \"Protecting the atmosphere\" below), such life would need to be cultivated inside a closed system.\\nOn April 26, 2012, scientists reported that lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).\\nOne final issue with albedo reduction is the common Martian dust storms. These cover the entire planet for weeks, and not only increase the albedo, but block sunlight from reaching the surface. This has been observed to cause a surface temperature drop which the planet takes months to recover from. Once the dust settles it then covers whatever it lands on, effectively erasing the albedo reduction material from the view of the Sun..', \"Countering the effects of space weather\\nMars has no intrinsic global magnetic field, but the solar wind directly interacts with the atmosphere of Mars, leading to the formation of a magnetosphere from magnetic field tubes. This poses challenges for mitigating solar radiation and retaining an atmosphere.\\nThe lack of a magnetic field, its relatively small mass, and its atmospheric photochemistry, all would have contributed to the evaporation and loss of its surface liquid water over time. Solar wind–induced ejection of Martian atmospheric atoms has been detected by Mars-orbiting probes, indicating that the solar wind has stripped the Martian atmosphere over time. The current loss rate of CO2 from Mars's atmosphere to space is equivalent to approximately 1 millibar per billion years .  For comparison, while Venus has a dense atmosphere, it has only traces of water vapor (20 ppm) as it lacks a large, dipole-induced, magnetic field.\\nEarth's ozone layer provides additional protection. Ultraviolet light is blocked before it can dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen.\"], 'ground_truth_chunks': ['88ae4373-5538-5c86-bf6d-e88b8a89ef3f'], 'precision_at_k': 0.0, 'recall_at_k': 0.0, 'reciprocal_rank': 0.0, 'ndcg_at_k': 0.0, 'topic': 'mars', 'level': 'College', 'metadata': None}\n"
