Ancient astronomers were able to make geometric observations with various instruments. The collection of precise observations in the early modern period and the invention of the telescope helped determine the overall structure of the Solar System. Telescopic observations resulted in the discovery of moons and rings around planets, and new planets, comets and the asteroids; the recognition of planets as other worlds, of Earth as another planet, and stars as other suns; the identification of the Solar System as an entity in itself, and the determination of the distances to some nearby stars.\\nFor millennia, what today is known to be the Solar System was regarded as the \"whole universe\", so the knowledge of both mostly advanced in parallel. A clear distinction was not made until around the mid-17th century. Since then, incremental knowledge has been gained not only about the Solar System, but also about outer space and its deep-sky objects.\\nThe composition of stars and planets was investigated with spectroscopy. Observations of Solar System bodies with other types of electromagnetic radiation became possible with radio astronomy, infrared astronomy, ultraviolet astronomy, X-ray astronomy, and gamma-ray astronomy.\\nRobotic space probes, the Apollo program landings of humans on the Moon, and space telescopes have vastly increased human knowledge about the atmosphere, geology, and electromagnetic properties of other planets, giving rise to the new field of planetary science.\\nThe Solar System is one of many planetary systems in the galaxy. The planetary system that contains Earth is named the \"Solar\" System. The word \"solar\" is derived from the Latin word for Sun, Sol (genitive Solis). Anything related to the Sun is called \"solar\": for example, stellar wind from the Sun is called solar wind.', 'chunk_index': 0, 'char_start': 0, 'char_end': 836, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:53.997985+00:00'}\n"

Research and exploration of the Moon have been a large focus of the organization since the Apollo program. NASA's peak budget was in 1964–1965, when it comprised 4% of all federal spending in service of the Apollo Moon landing project. Though lunar landings since the conclusion of the Apollo program in 1972 have ceased, interest in establishing a permanent habitation on the lunar surface or beyond low Earth orbit has remained steady. Recently, renewed interest in lunar landing has led to increased funding and project planning. NASA requested an increase in the 2020 budget of $1.6 billion, in order to make another crewed mission to the Moon under the Artemis program by 2025 (originally 2024), (delayed to 2026) followed by a sustained presence on the Moon by 2028. A crew was selected for the planned crewed mission, Artemis II, in April 2023.\", 'chunk_index': 11, 'char_start': 7582, 'char_end': 8174, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:54.053138+00:00',

Research and exploration of the Moon have been a large focus of the organization since the Apollo program. NASA's peak budget was in 1964–1965, when it comprised 4% of all federal spending in service of the Apollo Moon landing project. Though lunar landings since the conclusion of the Apollo program in 1972 have ceased, interest in establishing a permanent habitation on the lunar surface or beyond low Earth orbit has remained steady. Recently, renewed interest in lunar landing has led to increased funding and project planning. NASA requested an increase in the 2020 budget of $1.6 billion, in order to make another crewed mission to the Moon under the Artemis program by 2025 (originally 2024), (delayed to 2026) followed by a sustained presence on the Moon by 2028. A crew was selected for the planned crewed mission, Artemis II, in April 2023.\", 'chunk_index': 11, 'char_start': 7582, 'char_end': 8174, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:54.053138+00:00',

It is not explicitly necessary as the initial boost given by the rocket, gravity slingshot, monopropellant/bipropellent attitude control propulsion system are enough for the exploration of the solar system (see New Horizons). Once it has done so, it must make its way to its destination. Current interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of short-term trajectory adjustments. In between these adjustments, the spacecraft typically moves along its trajectory without accelerating. The most fuel-efficient means to move from one circular orbit to another is with a Hohmann transfer orbit: the spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun. A short period of thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous orbit and also to the orbit of its destination. The spacecraft falls freely along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its destination.\", 'title': 'Spacecraft propulsion', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion', 'categories': ['Category:Discovery and exploration of the Solar System', 'Category:Glenn Research Center', 'Category:NASA programs', 'Category:Spacecraft components', 'Category:Spacecraft propulsion', 'Category:Spaceflight technology'], 'topic': 'other', 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Creative_Commons_by_small.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Earth-moon.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Engine_of_APOLLO_Eagle.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Ion_Engine_Test_Firing_-_GPN-2000-000482.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Lightcraft.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Patent_Family_publications_in_Sustainable_Propulsion.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Pathfinder_Air_Bags_-_GPN-2000-000484.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg'], 'summary': 'Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites. In-space propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be confused with space launch or atmospheric entry.\\nSeveral methods of pragmatic spacecraft propulsion have been developed, each having its own drawbacks and advantages. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping, while a few use momentum wheels for attitude control. Russian and antecedent Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north–south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used electric propulsion such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters. Various technologies need to support everything from small satellites and robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to Mars.\\nHypothetical in-space propulsion technologies describe propulsion technologies that could meet future space science and exploration needs. These propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective exploration of the Solar System and may permit mission designers to plan missions to \"fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations\" and with greater reliability and safety. With a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are \"best\" for future missions is a difficult one; expert opinion now holds that a portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations.', 'chunk_index': 13, 'char_start': 10628, 'char_end': 11799,

Typically a Disk-Gap-Band parachute has been used, but another possibility are trailing or attached inflatable     entry devices. Inflatable types include sphere w/ fence, teardrop w/ fence, isotensoid, torus, or tension cone and attached types include isotensoid, tension cone, and stacked toroid blunted cone. Viking Program era researchers were the true pioneers of this technology, and development had to be restarted after decades of neglect. Those latest studies have shown that tension cone, isotensoid, and stacked torus may be the best types to pursue.\\nFinland's MetNet probe may use an expandable entry shield if it is sent. Martian air can also be used for aerobraking to orbital velocity (aerocapture), rather than descent and landing. Supersonic retro-propulsion is another concept to shed velocity.\\nNASA is carrying out research on retropropulsive deceleration technologies to develop new approaches to Mars atmospheric entry.\", 'title': 'Mars atmospheric entry', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_atmospheric_entry', 'categories': ['Category:Atmosphere of Mars', 'Category:Exploration of Mars', 'Category:Extraterrestrial atmosphere entry'], 'topic': 'mars', 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/2001_mars_odyssey_wizja.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/675608main_edl20120809-full.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/HiRISE_Captured_Perseverance_During_Descent_to_Mars_%28cropped%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/MSL_Artist_Concept_%28PIA14164_crop%29.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/MSL_HeatShield.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Mars-Science-Laboratory-Mars-Entry-Trajectory.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Opportunity_heat_shield_Sol335B_P2364_L456-B339R1.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Phoenix_Lander_seen_from_MRO_during_EDL2.jpg'], 'summary': 'Mars atmospheric entry is the entry into the atmosphere of Mars.

Formed in 1993, MEP has made use of orbital spacecraft, landers, and Mars rovers to explore the possibilities of life on Mars, as well as the planet's climate and natural resources. The program is managed by NASA's Science Mission Directorate by Doug McCuistion of the Planetary Science Division. As a result of 40% cuts to NASA's budget for fiscal year 2013, the Mars Program Planning Group (MPPG) was formed to help reformulate the MEP, bringing together leaders of NASA's technology, science, human operations, and science missions.\", 'chunk_index': 16, 'char_start': 13799, 'char_end': 13914, 'created_at': '2025-10-04T21:29:54.216492+00:00', 'embedding': [0.06651762872934341,

Probes sent from Earth, beginning in the late 20th century, have yielded a large increase in knowledge about the Martian system, focused primarily on understanding its geology and habitability potential. Engineering interplanetary journeys is complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly sixty percent of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their missions, with some failing before their observations could begin. Some missions have been met with unexpected success, such as the twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which operated for years beyond their specification.', 'chunk_index': 11,

The Fe-sulphide probably formed in deep water from water heated by volcanoes.  Such a process, classified as hydrothermal may have been a place where life began. Saponite, talc, talc-saponite, nontronite, glauconite, and serpentine are all common on the seafloors on Earth. The earliest evidence of life on Earth appear in seafloor deposits that are similar to those found in the Eridania basin.  So, samples of material from the Eridania may give us insight into the environment of the early Earth.  Chloride deposits were found where a shoreline existed.  They were deposited as water evaporated from the sea.  These chloride deposits are thought to be thin (less than 30 meters), because some craters do not display the chemical in their ejecta.  A crater's ejecta contains material from under the surface, therefore if the chloride deposits were very deep they would have appeared in the ejecta.\", \"Cassini orbiter\\nOn July 1, 2004, the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft performed the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered into orbit around Saturn. Before the SOI, Cassini had already studied the system extensively. In June 2004, it had conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data.\\nThe orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on December 25, 2004. Huygens descended onto the surface of Titan on January 14, 2005, sending a flood of data during the atmospheric descent and after the landing. During 2005 Cassini conducted multiple flybys of Titan and icy satellites.\\nOn March 10, 2006, NASA reported that the Cassini probe found evidence of liquid water reservoirs that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus.\\nOn September 20, 2006, a Cassini probe photograph revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E rings.\\nIn July 2006, Cassini saw the first proof of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, which was confirmed in January 2007.\", 'In the study region, Tivat Crater, rockfall markings faded at the same time as recurrent slope lineae (RSL), suggesting a fading mechanism that acts across the whole crater..', 'Rocks\\nSome excitement from finding meteorites, new types of rock or signatures detected from orbit, and speculations on ancient alien fossils which as of yet lean towards geological processes.\\nExamples', \"Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. A third new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea and Io.\\nThe discovery of volcanic activity on the moon Io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission, as it was the first time an active volcano was observed on a celestial body other than Earth. Together, the Voyagers recorded the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, as well as evidence for other eruptions occurring between the Voyager encounters.\\nEuropa displayed a large number of intersecting linear features in the low-resolution photos from Voyager 1. At first, scientists believed the features might be deep cracks, caused by crustal rifting or tectonic processes. The high-resolution photos from Voyager 2, taken closer to Jupiter, left scientists puzzled as the features in these photos were almost entirely lacking in topographic relief. This led many to suggest that these cracks might be similar to ice floes on Earth, and that Europa might have a liquid water interior.\", 'In the hours prior to Voyager 1\\'s encounter with Io, the spacecraft acquired images for a global map with a resolution of at least 20 km (12 mi) per pixel over the satellite\\'s leading hemisphere (the side that faces the moon\\'s direction of motion around Jupiter) down to less than 1 km (0.6 mi) per pixel over portions of the sub-Jovian hemisphere (the \"near\" side of Io). The images returned during the approach revealed a strange, multi-colored landscape devoid of impact craters, unlike the other planetary surfaces imaged to that point such as the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. The dark spots in earlier images resembled volcanic calderas more than they did the impact craters seen on those other worlds. Stunned by the oddity of Io\\'s surface, Voyager imaging scientist Laurence Soderblom at a pre-encounter press conference joked, \"this one we got all figured out...[Io] is covered with thin candy shells of anything from sulfates and sulfur and salts to all kinds of strange things.\".', 'As Venus, Titan also possesses an opaque atmosphere.\\nBy 2018, there have been radar observations of 138 main belt asteroids, 789 near-Earth asteroids, and 20 comets, including 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann..', \"During Galileo's ninth orbit, the spacecraft observed a major eruption at Pillan Patera, detecting high-temperature thermal emission and a new volcanic plume.

During the following orbit, Galileo found that Pillan was surrounded by a new, dark pyroclastic deposit composed of silicate minerals such as orthopyroxene.

The average temperature of the atmosphere of the planet is about 59 K (−214.2 °C). Surprisingly, the illuminated and dark poles, and most of the planet, show nearly the same temperature at the cloud tops.\\nVoyager 2 found 10 new moons, bringing the total number to 15 at the time. Most of the new moons are small, with the largest measuring about 150 km (93 mi) in diameter.\\nThe moon Miranda, innermost of the five large moons, was revealed to be one of the strangest bodies yet seen in the Solar System. Detailed images from Voyager 2\\'s flyby of the moon showed huge oval structures termed coronae flanked by faults as deep as 20 km (12 mi), terraced layers, and a mixture of old and young surfaces. One theory holds that Miranda may be a reaggregation of material from an earlier time when the moon was fractured by a violent impact.\\nThe five large moons appear to be ice–rock conglomerates like the satellites of Saturn.', \"Martian moons, Ceres, asteroids\\nOther proposals are based on Phobos and Deimos. These moons are in reasonably high orbits above Mars, have very low escape velocities, and unlike Mars have return delta-v's from their surfaces to LEO which are less than the return from the Moon.\\nCeres is further out than Mars, with a higher delta-v, but launch windows and travel times are better, and the surface gravity is just 0.028 g, with a very low escape velocity of 510 m/s. Researchers have speculated that the interior configuration of Ceres includes a water-ice-rich mantle over a rocky core.\\nNear Earth Asteroids and bodies in the asteroid belt could also be sources of raw materials for ISRU.\", \"Equatorial regions\\nThe lunar equatorial regions are likely to have higher concentrations of helium-3 (rare on Earth but much sought after for use in nuclear fusion research) because the solar wind has a higher angle of incidence. They also enjoy an advantage in extra-Lunar traffic: The rotation advantage for launching material is slight due to the Moon's slow rotation, but the corresponding orbit coincides with the ecliptic, nearly coincides with the lunar orbit around Earth, and nearly coincides with the equatorial plane of Earth.\\nSeveral probes have landed in the Oceanus Procellarum area. There are many areas and features that could be subject to long-term study, such as the Reiner Gamma anomaly and the dark-floored Grimaldi crater.\", \"18th century\\nThe numbering of Titania and Oberon underwent some confusion, because in 1797, Herschel reported four more satellites of Uranus that turned out not to exist. Before any more Uranian moons were discovered, William Lassell sometimes adopted Herschel's numbers where Titania and Oberon are respectively Uranus II and IV, and sometimes called them respectively Uranus I and II. After he discovered Ariel and Umbriel in 1851, Lassell numbered the four real Uranian satellites then known outward from their parent planet as I (Ariel), II (Umbriel), III (Titania), and IV (Oberon), and this finally stuck.\", 'This included information on the lava flow rate at Prometheus, Amirani, and Tvashtar, very high resolution imaging of Chaac Patera and layered terrain in Bulicame Regio, and mapping of the mountains and topography around Camaxtli Patera, Zal Patera, and Shamshu Patera..', '\"It is ultimately much easier to journey to Mars from low Earth orbit than from the Moon and using the latter as a staging point is a pointless diversion of resources.\" While the Moon may superficially appear a good place to perfect Mars exploration and habitation techniques, the two bodies are radically different. The Moon has no atmosphere, no analogous geology and a much greater temperature range and rotational period of illumination. It is argued Antarctica, deserts of Earth, and precisely controlled chilled vacuum chambers on easily accessible NASA centers on Earth provide much better training grounds at lesser cost..', 'Martian system\\nMars has long been the subject of human interest. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent linear features were ascribed to intelligent design. Further telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos and Deimos, polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons, the Solar System\\'s tallest mountain. The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a thin atmosphere; it has a cold and desert-like surface.\\nOne way the surface of Mars has been categorized, is by thirty \"quadrangles\", with each quadrangle named for a prominent physiographic feature within that quadrangle.'], 'relevant_context_ids': ['240b5a47-7243-555c-9b6e-5511e09e9165'], 'precision_at_k': 0.0, 'recall_at_k': 0.0, 'reciprocal_rank': 0.0, 'ndcg_at_k': 0.0, 'topic': 'other', 'level': 'College', 'metadata': {'source_text': \"Titania is marked by huge fault systems and canyons indicating some degree of geologic, probably tectonic, activity in its history.

It also imaged Uranus's five large moons, revealing that their surfaces are covered with impact craters and canyons.\\nA number of dedicated exploratory missions to Uranus have been proposed, but as of 2023 none have been approved.\", \"It discovers the planet's F ring and determines that its moon Titan has a thick atmosphere.\\n1979 – Goldreich and Tremaine postulate that Saturn's F ring is maintained by shepherd moons, a prediction that would be confirmed by observations.\\n1979 – Voyager 1 flies by Jupiter and discovers its faint ring system, as well as volcanoes on Io, the innermost of its Galilean moons.\\n1979 – Voyager 2 flies by Jupiter and discovers evidence of an ocean under the surface of its moon Europa.\\n1980 – Voyager 1 flies by Saturn and takes the first images of Titan.\", \"It can reach 7°54′ in amplitude.\\n1648 – Blaise Pascal, aided by his brother-in-law Florin Périer at mount Puy de Dôme, shows that air pressure on a high mountain is less than at a lower altitude, proving his idea that, as air has a finite weight, Earth's atmosphere must have a maximum height.\\n1655 – Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Robert Hooke separately discover Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\\n1656 – Christiaan Huygens identifies Saturn's rings as rings and discovers its moon Titan.\\n1659 – Huygens estimated a value of about 24,000 Earth radii for the distance Earth-Sun, remarkably close to modern values but he was based on many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions; the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.\\n1665 – Cassini determines the rotational speeds of Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.\\n1668 – Isaac Newton builds his own reflecting telescope, the first fully functional of this kind, and a landmark for future developings as it reduces spherical aberration with no chromatic aberration.\\n1672 – Cassini discovers Saturn's moons Iapetus and Rhea.\\n1672 – Jean Richer and Cassini measure the Earth-Sun distance, the astronomical unit, to be about 138,370,000 km.\\n1675 – Ole Rømer uses the orbital mechanics of Jupiter's moons to estimate that the speed of light is about 227,000 km/s.\\n1675 – Cassini discovers the main division in the rings of Saturn, named after him, the Cassini Division.\\n1686 – Cassini discovers Saturn's moons Tethys and Dione.\\n1687 – Isaac Newton publishes his law of universal gravitation in his work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.\\n1690 – Cassini observes differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere..\", \"Uranus\\nThe exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its axial tilt of 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. Voyager 2 studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere. Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.\\nImages of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active.\", \"Future missions, such as Mars 2020, will carry more advanced chemical and geological detectors to Mars with them; some images taken by Opportunity have led to speculation about whether the images contain evidence of extraterrestrial life. One example, as reported by National Geographic, appears to show a cauliflower-shaped rock in an image taken by the Spirit rover in 2007, which, to some scientists, resembled fossils of microscopic stromatolites, which are ubiquitous on Earth, and represent the earliest widely accepted example of life in Earth's biosphere. Stromatolites, thought to be signs of some of the earliest life discovered on Earth, almost 4 billion years ago, are on Earth today. Another candidate are cynobacteria which are also determined to be among the oldest life on Earth. Because of the large impacts that eject matter into space Mars has exchanged material with over long time scales, leading some to suggest life could make the journey between Earth and Mars.\", \"Urey's model\\nAmerican chemist Harold Urey, who founded cosmochemistry, put forward a scenario in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites. His model also used Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. To explain that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets, he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. To form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, moon-sized objects, and gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable would have to form in the disk, with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions, considerable ionization would be present, and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun.\", \"Telescopic observations\\nEarly telescopic discoveries\\nThe invention of the telescope revolutionized astronomy, making it possible to see details about the Sun, Moon, and planets not available to the naked eye. It appeared around 1608 in the Netherlands, and was quickly adopted among European enthusiasts and astronomers to study the skies.\\nItalian polymath Galileo Galilei was an early user and made prolific discoveries, including the phases of Venus, which definitively disproved the arrangement of spheres in the Ptolemaic system.\\nGalileo also discovered that the Moon was cratered, that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it. Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn. Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four more moons of Saturn and the Cassini division in Saturn's rings.\"], 'relevant_context_ids': ['240b5a47-7243-555c-9b6e-5511e09e9165'], 'precision_at_k': 0.0, 'recall_at_k': 0.0, 'reciprocal_rank': 0.0, 'ndcg_at_k': 0.0, 'topic': 'other', 'level': 'Advanced', 'metadata': {'source_text': \"Titania is marked by huge fault systems and canyons indicating some degree of geologic, probably tectonic, activity in its history.

So, samples of material from the Eridania may give us insight into the environment of the early Earth.  Chloride deposits were found where a shoreline existed.  They were deposited as water evaporated from the sea.  These chloride deposits are thought to be thin (less than 30 meters), because some craters do not display the chemical in their ejecta.  A crater's ejecta contains material from under the surface, therefore if the chloride deposits were very deep they would have appeared in the ejecta.\", \"Cassini orbiter\\nOn July 1, 2004, the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft performed the SOI (Saturn Orbit Insertion) maneuver and entered into orbit around Saturn.

Stromatolites, thought to be signs of some of the earliest life discovered on Earth, almost 4 billion years ago, are on Earth today. Another candidate are cynobacteria which are also determined to be among the oldest life on Earth.

His model also used Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. To explain that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets, he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. To form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, moon-sized objects, and gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable would have to form in the disk, with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions, considerable ionization would be present, and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun.\", \"Telescopic observations\\nEarly telescopic discoveries\\nThe invention of the telescope revolutionized astronomy, making it possible to see details about the Sun, Moon, and planets not available to the naked eye.

The committee concluded that the Constellation program was massively underfunded and that a 2020 Moon landing was impossible.

The program\\'s logo reflected the three stages of the program: the Earth (ISS), the Moon, and finally Mars—while the Mars goal also found expression in the name given to the program\\'s booster rockets: Ares (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Mars). The technological aims of the program included the regaining of significant astronaut experience beyond low Earth orbit and the development of technologies necessary to enable sustained human presence on other planetary bodies.\\nConstellation began in response to the goals laid out in the Vision for Space Exploration under NASA Administrator Sean O\\'Keefe and President George W.

At the conference, President Obama and top officials, as well as leaders in the field of spaceflight, discussed the future of U.S. efforts in human spaceflight and unveiled a plan for NASA that followed the Augustine Panel\\'s \"Flexible Path to Mars\" option, modifying President Obama\\'s prior proposal to include the continuing development of the Orion capsule as an auxiliary system to the ISS and setting the year 2015 as the deadline for the design of a new Super Heavy Launch Vehicle. In October 2010, the NASA authorization bill for 2010 was signed into law which canceled Constellation.  However, previous legislation kept Constellation contracts in force until passage of a new funding bill for 2011..', 'On October 11, the signing of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 shelved the program, with Constellation contracts remaining in place until Congress would act to overturn the previous mandate. In 2011, NASA adopted the design of its new Space Launch System..', \"History\\nEarly history\\nThe Artemis program incorporates several major components of previously cancelled NASA programs and missions, including the Constellation program and the Asteroid Redirect Mission. Originally legislated by the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, Constellation included the development of Ares I, Ares V, and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. The program ran from the early 2000s until 2010.\\nIn May 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama established the Augustine Committee to take into account several objectives including support for the International Space Station, development of missions beyond low Earth orbit (including the Moon, Mars, and near-Earth objects), and use of the commercial space industry within defined budget limits. The committee concluded that the Constellation program was massively underfunded and that a 2020 Moon landing was impossible. Constellation was subsequently put on hold.\\nOn April 15, 2010, President Obama spoke at the Kennedy Space Center, announcing the administration's plans for NASA and cancelling the non-Orion elements of Constellation on the premise that the program had become nonviable.\", 'The Constellation program (abbreviated CxP) was a crewed spaceflight program developed by NASA, the space agency of the United States, from 2005 to 2009. The major goals of the program, in which no crewed missions flew before its cancellation, were \"completion of the International Space Station\" and a \"return to the Moon no later than 2020\" with a crewed flight to the planet Mars as the ultimate goal. The program\\'s logo reflected the three stages of the program: the Earth (ISS), the Moon, and finally Mars—while the Mars goal also found expression in the name given to the program\\'s booster rockets: Ares (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Mars). The technological aims of the program included the regaining of significant astronaut experience beyond low Earth orbit and the development of technologies necessary to enable sustained human presence on other planetary bodies.\\nConstellation began in response to the goals laid out in the Vision for Space Exploration under NASA Administrator Sean O\\'Keefe and President George W. Bush. O\\'Keefe\\'s successor, Michael D.', 'Griffin, ordered a complete review, termed the Exploration Systems Architecture Study, which reshaped how NASA would pursue the goals laid out in the Vision for Space Exploration, and its findings were formalized by the NASA Authorization Act of 2005.

Another review in 2009, ordered by President Obama, indicated that neither a return to the Moon nor a crewed flight to Mars was within NASA\\'s current budget. The Augustine panel proposed various options, that included two primary destination points (the Moon and deep space), three different types of Super Heavy Launch vehicles, and a robust research and development program that would include work on propellant depots.\\nAfter reviewing the report, and following congressional testimony, the Obama administration decided to exclude Constellation from the 2011 United States federal budget.
