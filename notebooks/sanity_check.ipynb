This includes the Sun, Earth and the Moon, the major planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, their satellites, as well as smaller bodies including comets, asteroids, and dust. In ancient and medieval times, only objects visible to the naked eye—the Sun, the Moon, the five classical planets, and comets, along with phenomena now known to take place in Earth\\'s atmosphere, like meteors and aurorae—were known. Ancient astronomers were able to make geometric observations with various instruments. The collection of precise observations in the early modern period and the invention of the telescope helped determine the overall structure of the Solar System. Telescopic observations resulted in the discovery of moons and rings around planets, and new planets, comets and the asteroids; the recognition of planets as other worlds, of Earth as another planet, and stars as other suns; the identification of the Solar System as an entity in itself, and the determination of the distances to some nearby stars. For millennia, what today is known to be the Solar System was regarded as the \"whole universe\", so the knowledge of both mostly advanced in parallel. A clear distinction was not made until around the mid-17th century. Since then, incremental knowledge has been gained not only about the Solar System, but also about outer space and its deep-sky objects. The composition of stars and planets was investigated with spectroscopy. Observations of Solar System bodies with other types of electromagnetic radiation became possible with radio astronomy, infrared astronomy, ultraviolet astronomy, X-ray astronomy, and gamma-ray astronomy. Robotic space probes, the Apollo program landings of humans on the Moon, and space telescopes have vastly increased human knowledge about the atmosphere, geology, and electromagnetic properties of other planets, giving rise to the new field of planetary science. The Solar System is one of many planetary systems in the galaxy. The planetary system that contains Earth is named the \"Solar\" System. The word \"solar\" is derived from the Latin word for Sun, Sol (genitive Solis). Anything related to the Sun is called \"solar\": for example, stellar wind from the Sun is called solar wind. Pre-telescope The first humans had limited understanding of the celestial bodies that could be seen in the sky. The Sun, however, was of immediate interest, as it generates the day-night cycle. Also, dawn and sunset always appear at roughly the same points of the horizon, which helped to develop the cardinal directions. The Moon was another body of immediate interest, because of its larger apparent size. The lunar phases helped them measure time in longer periods than days, and to predict the duration of the seasons. Prehistoric beliefs about the structure and origin of the universe were highly diverse, often rooted in religious cosmology, and many are unrecorded. Many associated the classical planets (star-like points visible with the naked eye) with deities, in part due to their puzzling forward and retrograde motion against the otherwise fixed stars, which gave them their nickname of \"wanderer stars\", πλάνητες ἀστέρες (planētes asteres) in Ancient Greek, from which today\\'s word \"planet\" was derived. Systematic astronomical observations were performed in many areas around the world, and started to inform cosmological knowledge, although they were mostly driven by astrological purposes such as divination and/or omens. Early historic civilizations in Egypt, the Levant, pre-Socratic Greece, Mesopotamia, and ancient China, recorded beliefs in a flat Earth. Vedic texts proposed a number of shapes, including a wheel (flat) and a bag (concave), though they likely promote a spherical Earth, which they refer to as bhugol (or भूगोल in Hindi and Sanskrit), which literally translates to \"spherical land\". Ancient models were typically geocentric, putting the Earth at the center of the universe, based solely on the common experience of seeing the skies slowly moving around above our heads, and by feeling the land under our feet to be firmly at rest. Some traditions in Chinese cosmology proposed an outer surface to which planets and the Sun and Moon were attached; another proposed that they were free-floating. All remaining stars were regarded as \"fixed\" in the background. One important discovery made at different times in different places is that the bright planet sometimes seen near the sunrise (called Phosphorus by the Greeks) and the bright planet sometimes seen near the sunset (called Hesperus by the Greeks) were actually the same planet, Venus. Though unclear if motivated by empirical observations, the concept of a spherical Earth apparently first gained intellectual dominance in the Pythagorean school in Ancient Greece in the 5th century BC. Meanwhile, the Pythagorean astronomical system proposed the Earth and Sun and a counter-Earth rotate around an unseen \"Central Fire\". Influenced by Pythagoran thinking and Plato, philosophers Eudoxus, Callippus, and Aristotle all developed models of the solar system based on concentric spheres. These required more than one sphere per planet in order to account for the complicated curves they traced across the sky. Aristotelian physics used the Earth\\'s place at the center of the universe along with the theory of classical elements to explain phenomena such as falling rocks and rising flames; objects in the sky were theorized to be composed of a unique element called aether. A later geocentric model developed by Ptolemy attached smaller spheres to a smaller number of large spheres to explain the complex motions of the planets, a device known as deferent and epicycle first developed by Apollonius of Perga. Published in the Almagest, this model of celestial spheres surrounding a spherical Earth was reasonably accurate and predictive, and became dominant among educated people in various cultures, spreading from Ancient Greece to Ancient Rome, Christian Europe, the Islamic world, South Asia, and China via inheritance and copying of texts, conquest, trade, and missionaries. It remained in widespread use until the 16th century. Heliocentric model Various astronomers, especially those who had access to more precise observations, were skeptical of the geocentric model and proposed alternatives, including', 'title': 'Discovery and exploration of the Solar System', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_exploration_of_the_Solar_System', 'categories': ['Category:All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'Category:All accuracy disputes', 'Category:All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements', 'Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2022', 'Category:Articles incorporating a citation from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia with Wikisource reference', 'Category:Articles with disputed statements from January 2024', 'Category:Articles with short description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from April 2024', 'Category:CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'Category:CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'Category:CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'Category:CS1 errors: ISBN date', 'Category:Discovery and exploration of the Solar System', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Category:Solar System', 'Category:Webarchive template wayback links', 'Category:Wikipedia articles in need of updating from August 2016', 'Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference'], 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/%28253%29_mathilde_crop.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/17pHolmes_071104_eder_vga.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/1851_07_28_Berkowski.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/20000-varuna_hst.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/2007_UK126_Hubble_%28crop%29.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/225088_Gonggong_and_Xiangliu_by_Hubble_%28clean%29.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/243_Ida_large.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/2867_%C5%A0teins_by_Rosetta_%28reprocessed%29.png'], 'summary': 'Discovery and exploration of the Solar System is observation, visitation, and increase in knowledge and understanding of Earth\\'s \"cosmic neighborhood\".
