This includes the Sun, Earth and the Moon, the major planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, their satellites, as well as smaller bodies including comets, asteroids, and dust. In ancient and medieval times, only objects visible to the naked eye—the Sun, the Moon, the five classical planets, and comets, along with phenomena now known to take place in Earth\\'s atmosphere, like meteors and aurorae—were known. Ancient astronomers were able to make geometric observations with various instruments. The collection of precise observations in the early modern period and the invention of the telescope helped determine the overall structure of the Solar System. Telescopic observations resulted in the discovery of moons and rings around planets, and new planets, comets and the asteroids; the recognition of planets as other worlds, of Earth as another planet, and stars as other suns; the identification of the Solar System as an entity in itself, and the determination of the distances to some nearby stars. For millennia, what today is known to be the Solar System was regarded as the \"whole universe\", so the knowledge of both mostly advanced in parallel. A clear distinction was not made until around the mid-17th century. Since then, incremental knowledge has been gained not only about the Solar System, but also about outer space and its deep-sky objects. The composition of stars and planets was investigated with spectroscopy. Observations of Solar System bodies with other types of electromagnetic radiation became possible with radio astronomy, infrared astronomy, ultraviolet astronomy, X-ray astronomy, and gamma-ray astronomy. Robotic space probes, the Apollo program landings of humans on the Moon, and space telescopes have vastly increased human knowledge about the atmosphere, geology, and electromagnetic properties of other planets, giving rise to the new field of planetary science. The Solar System is one of many planetary systems in the galaxy. The planetary system that contains Earth is named the \"Solar\" System. The word \"solar\" is derived from the Latin word for Sun, Sol (genitive Solis). Anything related to the Sun is called \"solar\": for example, stellar wind from the Sun is called solar wind. Pre-telescope The first humans had limited understanding of the celestial bodies that could be seen in the sky. The Sun, however, was of immediate interest, as it generates the day-night cycle. Also, dawn and sunset always appear at roughly the same points of the horizon, which helped to develop the cardinal directions. The Moon was another body of immediate interest, because of its larger apparent size. The lunar phases helped them measure time in longer periods than days, and to predict the duration of the seasons. Prehistoric beliefs about the structure and origin of the universe were highly diverse, often rooted in religious cosmology, and many are unrecorded. Many associated the classical planets (star-like points visible with the naked eye) with deities, in part due to their puzzling forward and retrograde motion against the otherwise fixed stars, which gave them their nickname of \"wanderer stars\", πλάνητες ἀστέρες (planētes asteres) in Ancient Greek, from which today\\'s word \"planet\" was derived. Systematic astronomical observations were performed in many areas around the world, and started to inform cosmological knowledge, although they were mostly driven by astrological purposes such as divination and/or omens. Early historic civilizations in Egypt, the Levant, pre-Socratic Greece, Mesopotamia, and ancient China, recorded beliefs in a flat Earth. Vedic texts proposed a number of shapes, including a wheel (flat) and a bag (concave), though they likely promote a spherical Earth, which they refer to as bhugol (or भूगोल in Hindi and Sanskrit), which literally translates to \"spherical land\". Ancient models were typically geocentric, putting the Earth at the center of the universe, based solely on the common experience of seeing the skies slowly moving around above our heads, and by feeling the land under our feet to be firmly at rest. Some traditions in Chinese cosmology proposed an outer surface to which planets and the Sun and Moon were attached; another proposed that they were free-floating. All remaining stars were regarded as \"fixed\" in the background. One important discovery made at different times in different places is that the bright planet sometimes seen near the sunrise (called Phosphorus by the Greeks) and the bright planet sometimes seen near the sunset (called Hesperus by the Greeks) were actually the same planet, Venus. Though unclear if motivated by empirical observations, the concept of a spherical Earth apparently first gained intellectual dominance in the Pythagorean school in Ancient Greece in the 5th century BC. Meanwhile, the Pythagorean astronomical system proposed the Earth and Sun and a counter-Earth rotate around an unseen \"Central Fire\". Influenced by Pythagoran thinking and Plato, philosophers Eudoxus, Callippus, and Aristotle all developed models of the solar system based on concentric spheres. These required more than one sphere per planet in order to account for the complicated curves they traced across the sky. Aristotelian physics used the Earth\\'s place at the center of the universe along with the theory of classical elements to explain phenomena such as falling rocks and rising flames; objects in the sky were theorized to be composed of a unique element called aether. A later geocentric model developed by Ptolemy attached smaller spheres to a smaller number of large spheres to explain the complex motions of the planets, a device known as deferent and epicycle first developed by Apollonius of Perga. Published in the Almagest, this model of celestial spheres surrounding a spherical Earth was reasonably accurate and predictive, and became dominant among educated people in various cultures, spreading from Ancient Greece to Ancient Rome, Christian Europe, the Islamic world, South Asia, and China via inheritance and copying of texts, conquest, trade, and missionaries. It remained in widespread use until the 16th century. Heliocentric model Various astronomers, especially those who had access to more precise observations, were skeptical of the geocentric model and proposed alternatives, including', 'title': 'Discovery and exploration of the Solar System', 'source_url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_exploration_of_the_Solar_System', 'categories': ['Category:All Wikipedia articles in need of updating', 'Category:All accuracy disputes', 'Category:All articles containing potentially dated statements', 'Category:All articles with unsourced statements', 'Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2022', 'Category:Articles incorporating a citation from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia with Wikisource reference', 'Category:Articles with disputed statements from January 2024', 'Category:Articles with short description', 'Category:Articles with unsourced statements from April 2024', 'Category:CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'Category:CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'Category:CS1 Spanish-language sources (es)', 'Category:CS1 errors: ISBN date', 'Category:Discovery and exploration of the Solar System', 'Category:Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Category:Solar System', 'Category:Webarchive template wayback links', 'Category:Wikipedia articles in need of updating from August 2016', 'Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating a citation from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica with Wikisource reference'], 'images': ['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/%28253%29_mathilde_crop.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/17pHolmes_071104_eder_vga.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/1851_07_28_Berkowski.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/20000-varuna_hst.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/2007_UK126_Hubble_%28crop%29.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/225088_Gonggong_and_Xiangliu_by_Hubble_%28clean%29.png', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/243_Ida_large.jpg', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/2867_%C5%A0teins_by_Rosetta_%28reprocessed%29.png'], 'summary': 'Discovery and exploration of the Solar System is observation, visitation, and increase in knowledge and understanding of Earth\\'s \"cosmic neighborhood\".

Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a brushed DC electric motor capable of 0.25 horsepower (190 W) at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit. In the case of drive failure, astronauts could remove pins to disengage the drive from the wheel, allowing the wheel to spin freely. Maneuvering capability was provided through the use of front and rear steering motors. Each series-wound DC steering motor was capable of 0.1 horsepower (75 W). The front and rear wheels could pivot in opposite directions to achieve a tight turning radius of 10 feet (3 m), or could be decoupled so only front or rear would be used for steering. The wheels were linked in Ackermann steering geometry, where the inside tires have a greater turn angle than the outside tires, to avoid sideslip. Power was provided by two 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries developed by Eagle-Picher with a charge capacity of 121 A·h each (a total of 242 A·h), yielding a range of 57 miles (92 km). These were used to power the drive and steering motors and also a 36-volt utility outlet mounted on the front of the LRV to power the communications relay unit or the TV camera. LRV batteries and electronics were passively cooled, using change-of-phase wax thermal capacitor packages and reflective, upward-facing radiating surfaces. While driving, radiators were covered with mylar blankets to minimize dust accumulation. When stopped, the astronauts would open the blankets, and manually remove excess dust from the cooling surfaces with hand brushes. Control and navigation A T-shaped hand controller situated between the two seats controlled the four drive motors, two steering motors, and brakes. Moving the stick forward powered the LRV forward, left and right turned the vehicle left or right, and pulling backwards activated the brakes. Activating a switch on the handle before pulling back would put the LRV into reverse. Pulling the handle all the way back activated a parking brake. The control and display modules were situated in front of the handle and gave information on the speed, heading, pitch, and power and temperature levels. Navigation was based on continuously recording direction and distance through use of a directional gyro and odometer and feeding this data to a computer that would keep track of the overall direction and distance back to the LM. There was also a Sun-shadow device that could give a manual heading based on the direction of the Sun, using the fact that the Sun moved very slowly in the sky. Usage The LRV was used during the lunar surface operations of Apollo 15, 16 and 17, the J missions of the Apollo program. On each mission, the LRV was used on three separate EVAs, for a total of nine lunar traverses, or sorties. During operation, the commander (CDR) always drove, while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was a passenger who assisted with navigation. An operational constraint on the use of the LRV was that the astronauts must be able to walk back to the LM if the LRV were to fail at any time during the EVA (called the \"Walkback Limit\"). Thus, the traverses were limited in the distance they could go at the start and at any time later in the EVA. Therefore, they went to the farthest point away from the LM and worked their way back to it so that, as the life support consumables were depleted, their remaining walk back distance was equally diminished. This constraint was relaxed during the longest traverse on Apollo 17, based on the demonstrated reliability of the LRV and spacesuits on previous missions. A paper by Burkhalter and Sharp provides details on usage. Deployment Astronaut deployment of the Lunar Roving Vehicle from the LM\\'s open Quadrant 1 bay was achieved with a system of pulleys and braked reels using ropes and cloth tapes. The rover was folded and stored in the bay with the underside of the chassis facing out. One astronaut would climb the egress ladder on the LM and release the rover, which would then be slowly tilted out by the second astronaut on the ground through the use of reels and tapes. As the rover was let down from the bay, most of the deployment was automatic. The rear wheels folded out and locked in place. When they touched the ground, the front of the rover could be unfolded, the wheels deployed, and the entire frame let down to the surface by pulleys. The rover components locked into place upon opening. Cabling, pins, and tripods would then be removed and the seats and footrests raised. After switching on all the electronics, the vehicle was ready to back away from the LM. Locations Four flight-ready LRVs were manufactured, as well as several others for testing and training. Three were transported to and left on the Moon via the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions (LRV-1 to 3), with the fourth (LRV-4) used for spare parts for the first three following the cancellation of Apollo 18. The rover used on Apollo 15 was left at Hadley-Apennine (26.10°N 3.65°E\\ufeff / 26.10; 3.65\\ufeff (Apollo 15 Lunar Roving Vehicle at Hadley–Apennine)). The rover used on Apollo 16 was left at Descartes (8.99°S 15.51°E\\ufeff / -8.99; 15.51\\ufeff (Apollo 16 Lunar Roving Vehicle at Descartes Highlands)). The rover used on Apollo 17 was left at Taurus-Littrow (20.16°N 30.76°E\\ufeff / 20.16; 30.76\\ufeff (Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle at Taurus-Littrow)) and was seen by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter during passes in 2009 and 2011. In 2020 the State of Washington designated the flown rovers as historic landmarks. Since only the upper stages of the lunar excursion modules could return to lunar orbit from the surface, the vehicles, along with the lower stages were abandoned. As a result, the only lunar rovers on display are LRV-4, test vehicles, trainers, and mock-ups.

The magnetic field strength would have to have been 1 gauss. The existence of torque depended on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk, a consequence of a well-known magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theorem on frozen-in lines of force. As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1,000 K (730 °C; 1,340 °F), numerous refractories must have been solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would have grown with condensation and accretion. These particles would have been swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth\\'s orbit was less than 1 meter, so as the disk moved outward, a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remained behind, where the terrestrial planets would form. The model agrees with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling. However, it does not explain twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. Alfvén formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines. Kuiper\\'s hypothesis Gerard Kuiper in 1944 argued, like Ter Haar, that regular eddies would be impossible and postulated that large gravitational instabilities might occur in the solar nebula, forming condensations. In this, the solar nebula could be either co-genetic with the Sun or captured by it. Density distribution would determine what could form, a planetary system or a stellar companion. The two types of planets were assumed to have resulted from the Roche limit. No explanation was offered for the Sun\\'s slow rotation, which Kuiper saw as a larger G-star problem. Whipple\\'s hypothesis In Fred Whipple\\'s 1948 scenario, a smoke cloud about 60,000 AU in diameter and with 1 solar mass (M☉) contracted and produced the Sun. It had a negligible angular momentum, thus accounting for the Sun\\'s similar property. This smoke cloud captured a smaller one with a large angular momentum. The collapse time for the large smoke and gas nebula is about 100 million years, and the rate was slow at first, increasing in later stages. The planets condensed from small clouds developed in or captured by the second cloud. The orbits would be nearly circular because accretion would reduce eccentricity due to the influence of the resisting medium, and orbital orientations would be similar because of the size of the small cloud and the common direction of the motions. The protoplanets might have heated up to such high degrees that the more volatile compounds would have been lost, and the orbital velocity decreased with increasing distance so that the terrestrial planets would have been more affected. However, this scenario was weak in that practically all the final regularities are introduced as a prior assumption, and quantitative calculations did not support most of the hypothesizing. For these reasons, it did not gain wide acceptance. Urey\\'s model American chemist Harold Urey, who founded cosmochemistry, put forward a scenario in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites. His model also used Chandrasekhar\\'s stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. To explain that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets, he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. To form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, moon-sized objects, and gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable would have to form in the disk, with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions, considerable ionization would be present, and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun. Urey postulated that these lunar-size bodies were destroyed by collisions, with the gas dissipating, leaving behind solids collected at the core, with the resulting smaller fragments pushed far out into space and the larger fragments staying behind and accreting into planets. He suggested the Moon was such a surviving core. Protoplanet hypothesis In 1960, 1963, and 1978, W. H. McCrea proposed the protoplanet hypothesis, in which the Sun and planets individually coalesced from matter within the same cloud, with the smaller planets later captured by the Sun\\'s larger gravity. It includes fission in a protoplanetary nebula and excludes a solar nebula. Agglomerations of floccules, which are presumed to compose the supersonic turbulence assumed to occur in the interstellar material from which stars are born, formed the Sun and protoplanets, the latter splitting to form planets. The two portions could not remain gravitationally bound to each other at a mass ratio of at least 8 to 1, and for inner planets, went into independent orbits, while for outer planets, one portion exited the Solar System. The inner protoplanets were Venus-Mercury and Earth-Mars. The moons of the greater planets were formed from \"droplets\" in the neck connecting the two portions of the dividing protoplanet. These droplets could account for some asteroids. Terrestrial planets would have no major moons, which does not account for the Moon. The hypothesis also predicts certain observations, such as the similar angular velocity of Mars and Earth with similar rotation periods and axial tilts. In this scheme, there are six principal planets: two terrestrial, Venus and Earth; two major, Jupiter and Saturn; and two outer, Uranus and Neptune, along with three lesser planets: Mercury, Mars, and Pluto. This hypothesis has some problems, such as failing to explain the fact that the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction with relatively low eccentricity, which would appear highly unlikely if they were each individually captured. Cameron\\'s hypothesis In American astronomer Alastair G. W. Cameron\\'s hypothesis from 1962 and 1963, the protosun, with a mass of about 1–2 Suns and a diameter of around 100,000 AU, was gravitationally unstable, collapsed, and broke into smaller subunits.

The first recorded use of the term \"Solar System\" dates from 1704. Since the seventeenth century, philosophers and scientists have been forming hypotheses concerning the origins of the Solar System and the Moon and attempting to predict how the Solar System would change in the future. René Descartes was the first to hypothesize on the beginning of the Solar System; however, more scientists joined the discussion in the eighteenth century, forming the groundwork for later hypotheses on the topic. Later, particularly in the twentieth century, a variety of hypotheses began to build up, including the now–commonly accepted nebular hypothesis.\\nMeanwhile, hypotheses explaining the evolution of the Sun originated in the nineteenth century, especially as scientists began to understand how stars in general functioned. In contrast, hypotheses attempting to explain the origin of the Moon have been circulating for centuries, although all of the widely accepted hypotheses were proven false by the Apollo missions in the mid-twentieth century. Following Apollo, in 1984, the giant impact hypothesis was composed, replacing the already-disproven binary accretion model as the most common explanation for the formation of the Moon.',
